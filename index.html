        he substantive title of "lord of the manor" 
        <br><br><br> registered manors will continue to be recorded in the register, on the appropriate notification. Thus in effect the register is closed for new registrations.[5] Such titles are legally classified as "incorporeal hereditaments" as they have no physical existence,[6] and usually have no intrinsic value. However a lucrative market arose in the 20th century for such titles, often for purposes of vanity, which was assisted by the existence of an official register, giving the purchaser the impression of a physical existence. Whether a title of "Lord of the Manor" is registered or unregistered has no effect on its legal validity or existence, which is a matter of law to be determined by the courts. Modern legal cases have been won by persons claiming rights as lords of the manor over village greens. The heads of many ancient English land-owning families have continued to be lords of the manor of lands they have inherited.
